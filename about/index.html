            Hello there — this is my small corner of the internet. Inspired by geocities websites aesthetic.
            This site is a mix of experiments, digital notes, and the occasional photo that made me stop and look twice.

            I would like to occasionally also update my projects/blog.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm interested in computers, photography, sound, and the aesthetics of the early web.. and cats.

            I'm fluint in Linux systems, especially Arch and Debian and networking. However I also have a passion for
            embedded firmware
            and audio systems. You can checkout my projects on my vlog!
