        During my tenure with the Integrated Digital/Analogue Circuits (IDAC) team
        at IEE, IHU, as a guitar player I was set to create an arduino-based
        Multieffect Guitar Pedal. This is just a fun and cheap little project to
        venture into electronics, an arduino is not powerful enough to be a good
        DSP so I would suggest using an ESP32. This project was made thanks to
        <a href="https://www.electrosmash.com/pedalshield-uno">this</a> already
        done implementation, albeit with some changes. First of all, I used an
        Arduino nano clone, which features the same hardware but with a more
        compact size. Secondly, the article suggests using a TL972 Op-Amp which
        was low in stock at the time of making so I improvised and used a (worse)
        alternative being the MCP6002. Lastly, I used a different configuration
        for interacting with the arduino. A toggle switch was used for controlling
        the volume/pitch while a pushbutton was used for cycling through effects,
        provided there's enough memory. I also excluded the trimmer.

        The schematic is simple enough. At first there's an input stage to
        pre-amplify the signal using the op-amp's first input. In my case since I
        don't use a trimmer, it amplifies the sound by
        <span style="color: #d3869b"
          >G = 1 + Rf/Rin = 1 + 100k/4.7k = 22 times</span
        >. Some filters are also applied to the signal. Then it enters the arduino
        through the analogue <span style="color: #8ec07c">pin A0</span>. After
        that, the arduino acts as a Digital Signal Processor using code from the
        site I posted earlier. In the output stage, the signal passes through the
        input 2 of the op-amp without further amplification. The op-amp acts as a
        voltage follower as a way to isolate the signal from the output current
        and reduce noise. Additional filters are applied.
