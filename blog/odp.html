    <h1>Organisational Data Mining: Clustering and ML with Python</h1>

  <p>
    Ths project was an assignment for the course "Organizational Data Mining"
    of IHU, IEE on the dataset "marketing.csv" for defining clusters of the
    samples and finding relationships between subjects based on their income.
    Written in python, using the libraries scikit learn for clustering and
    machine learning algorithms, matplotlib/seaborn for showing graphs and
    visualising data and apyori for apriori algorithm. You can find the code
    at my github page
    <a href="https://github.com/konLiogka/ODEPergasia" target="_blank">here</a>

  <h2>Task A - Imputation</h2>
  <p>
    The task involves addressing missing values in the provided dataset,
    "marketing.csv," marked as '?' due to incomplete responses from
    respondents. To handle this issue, the KNNImputer function from the
    sklearn library is utilized. This method effectively fills missing values
    by searching for neighboring samples with similar characteristics, so
    there aren't outliers. It performs well for the current dataset. It would
    need more computational power for large datasets as it computes every
    distance between every sample. Experimentation with different imputation
    values reveals that a value of 35 yields optimal results. Before
    proceeding with clustering, data analysis is conducted using seaborn
    library to visualize relationships between some features I've chosen.
  </p>
  <h2>Task B - Clustering</h2>
  <p>
    In order to obtain clear results in clustering algorithms, it's crucial to
    choose an appropriate number of clusters (K) to avoid overfitting and
    misinterpretation. For the KMEANS algorithm, the elbow method is employed
    to determine the optimal K value. This method calculates the sum of
    squared errors for different K values and visualizes them to identify the
    point where the line starts to resemble a linear trend or an elbow shape.
    For the dataset in question, K is determined to be between 13-15. After
    determining the appropriate K value, parallel coordinates plots are
    generated for 7 features to observe how many clusters should be formed
    based on where distortion starts to diminish. Applying the KMEANS
    algorithm, parallel coordinates plots for features are created, using the
    same number of plots as clusters for better visualization. Hierarchical
    clustering divides samples into clusters based on similarity.
    Visualization using dendrograms suggests 12 clusters if a horizontal line
    is drawn at the 100 level. For DBSCAN, the challenge lies in determining
    suitable values for min points and epsilon. A distance-based method like
    k-distances helps identify these values. In the provided example, min
    points is found to be 35 and epsilon is 3.
  </p>
  <h2>Task C - Classification</h2>
  <p>
    For proper classification of classes 8 and 9, minority oversampling using
    SMOTE is applied to increase the number of samples in these classes for
    the training sets. Training and testing sets are split 80%-20%.

  <p>
    KNN, a widely used machine learning algorithm, can perform well depending
    on the value of K. Here, I set K to 35. The accuracy reaches 39%, with
    improved recall and precision for classes 8 and 9. However, for large
    datasets, training might be slow due to the algorithm needing to compute
    distances between samples.

  <p>
    Decision tree classifiers categorize data based on various decisions made
    at each node, offering straightforward interpretation. While the accuracy
    remains unchanged, there is an improvement in recall and precision,
    indicating fewer false negatives and false positives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Random forest performed the best (depth 15), which is essentially multiple
    decision trees. The output is decided by the output most trees agree with.
    SLightly better accuracy but overall better recall and precision.

  <h2>Task D - Apriori</h2>
  <p>
    The Apriori algorithm is utilized to discover correlations among the
    dataset by extracting rules. Lift, measuring the frequency of occurrence
    of associations relative to the random occurrence frequency, is employed
    here. All features are used, with manual mapping of numeric values to the
    responses. Setting the lift to 2.7 reveals various rules. Initially,
    individuals with low income are observed to live with their families.
    Conversely, married individuals tend to reside in the area for over 10
    years and own their homes, while those not in a relationship tend to rent
    apartments. Additionally, married couples have both single and dual
    income. Individuals with low income are either unemployed or students.
    English is the dominant language. Two-member families have their own
    homes. Individuals who own homes tend to be of Caucasian ethnicity. Those
    studying or in school live with their families.
