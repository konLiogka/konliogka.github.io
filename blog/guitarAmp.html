      This is a mini portable guitar amp powered by a 9V battery. The Sapphire
      Lite Amp schematic was designed by Idle Wrench @dylan159.9855 on discord.
      It is a simple amplifier that utilizes the chips TL072 for amplifying the
      sound and LM386 as power amplifier for the driver, which I sourced from
      some old logitech speakers.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      First of all, the dual op-amp TL072 is configured as non-inverting so the
      signal enters from the "+" input. A reference voltage of 4.5V is used so
      as to provide a constant source for biasing the op-amp. Two diodes are
      used as flyback diodes to protect the circuit from over voltages. The GAIN
      potentiometer is what makes the sound more "metal" as it pushes the
      waveform to its limits, effectively cutting the top.
      <br /><br />
      At the OUT1 of the TL072, there's a TONE potentiometer for adjusting the
      tone. If there's high resistance, it allows higher frequencies to pass.
      The signal goes once again into the second op-amp of the TL072, it doesnt
      amplify the sound but acts as a voltage follower to isolate the signal
      from load currents.
      <br /><br />
      The amplified and buffered signal is then sent to the power amplifier
      LM386. The built-in gain is not needed. Before sending the signal to the
      speaker it is VERY important to use a resistor in parallel to the speaker
      that matches the impedance of the speaker, as well as an electrolytic
      capacitor as a means to not short the amplifier's DC output to ground
      which makes them overheat and burn out.
